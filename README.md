# The forward-forward algorithm with PyTorch

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch implementation of the forward-forward algorithm. This project is inspired by an article below.
* Geoffrey Hinton, The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations, arXiv.2212.13345.

## Preresquisties
* PyTorch
* TorchVision
* NumPy
* Pandas

## How to train / evaluate
* Just run the command below
```
python main.py
```
* Then, you can get training results and f1-scores.
* Additionaly, main_notebook.ipynb does same work as main.py

## Notes
* I refered to great works such
[Keras implementation (at entire pipeline)](https://keras.io/examples/vision/forwardforward/) and 
[mohammadpz's work (at prediction task)](https://github.com/mohammadpz/pytorch_forward_forward)
